# Raspberry PI GPIO

This repository contains code and documentation related to using the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use the code in this repository, you will need:

- A Raspberry Pi
- A breadboard
- Jumper wires
- LEDs
- Resistors
- A push button

Even a Documentation file is given

### Installing

To get started, clone this repository onto your Raspberry Pi:

```
git clone https://github.com/CyberWarrior743/Raspberry_PI_GPIO.git
```

### Usage

The code in this repository demonstrates how to use the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi to control LEDs and read input from a push button.

There are three main scripts:

- `led_blink.py`: This script blinks an LED on and off.
- `led_dimming.py`: This script uses pulse width modulation (PWM) to dim an LED.
- `button_input.py`: This script reads input from a push button.
